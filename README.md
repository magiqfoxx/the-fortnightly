# The Fortnightly

## About
Libraries used: CRA to set up, React Router, styled-components + gh-pages.  
For the sake of exercise, all styling is done with styled-components. 
I'm aware it might not be the most efficient or logical approach.

## Room For Improvements
Fix picture animation and add transitions   
Make the hashtag list draggable  
True responsiveness (ex. real menu for desktop view)
